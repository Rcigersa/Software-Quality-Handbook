# Task Estimation in Scrum
## **Why is task estimation important and how is it carried out?**
To plan and estimate tasks, developers have to complete five processes in the following order: 
- **Create User Stories:** should be written by product owner in a way that ensures a clear depiction of the customer’s requirements so that they are comprehensible. 
- **Approve, estimate and commit user stories:** approve user stories for a sprint and estimate as a team the work necessary for developing the outlined functionality from process 1. 
- **Create tasks:** go back to the now committed user stories from step 2 and divide them into specific tasks documented in a task list. Ideally this is conducted during a task planning meeting. 
- **Estimate Tasks:** During task estimation meetings held by the Scrum core team, the necessary efforts for completing each individual task are estimated and documented in an effort estimated task list.
- **Create sprint backlog:** During sprint planning meetings held by the Scrum core team, a sprint backlog containing all tasks to be completed in the sprint are created. 


## **Estimation in Scrum**
Estimation in Scrum gives developers the opportunity to estimate required efforts for a given project which helps to plan ahead and ensure a successful completion if done correctly. Choosing the best strategy from the beginning will help the team develop a common understanding of the tasks. Since developers have different levels of knowledge and skills, the time it takes to complete a task varies depending on who is working on it. In a complicated system, estimates will always be inaccurate, and despite the fact that collective thinking contributes to mistakes, we continue to make estimates as a team because teams cherish the experience of working together.

### **Product backlog estimation:**
This is necessary to make long-term estimations and prioritize tasks.
- Select number of stories for the first sprint. 
- Make first sprint short (1 week instead of 1 month)
- Be aware that changes to the estimation may happen as the project progresses. 
- Document the progress in a burndown chart (x-axis are the sprints and the y-axis are the story points) to give all stakeholders visibility. 

### **Sprint backlog estimation**
This gives an overview over the number of tasks to be completed and therefore enables a fair distribution of the workload on each of the team members.
- Convert user stories in tasks and estimate the workload in hours.
- If a task exceeds 8 h duration divide it further. 
- Document the results in another chart (the days of the sprint on the x-axis and the number of hours on the y-axis)

### **Creating estimates in an agile team**
- Assign values to buckets and select user stories to be sorted into the buckets accordingly. 
- Discuss the features and requirements of each story.
- Vote within the team to make decisions.

Ideally, Scrum estimation gives the whole team an overview of the development process and a guideline to follow.   
Often story points are used to represent values of user stories/tasks in relation to other tasks in the process.

Use hours to measure tasks as it is more accurate.
While there are no set rules for how values are distributed, but ensure consistency throughout the process. If one story point value is set to 1 = 1h, 3 would equal 3h not 3 days and so on. 

**Dependencies:**  
**Estimate tasks in real time:** challenges are that the estimations are based on ideal scenarios rather than accounting for real-life challenges such as absences of team members, interruptions, or other problems occurring during the completion process of any given task. It is crucial for team members to define “ideal days”, as definitions may vary and if undetected can cause misalignments within the team.


### **Estimation Techniques**
The estimation technique you choose is determined by the final results you expect to see. The best way to find a method that works for you and your team is to try it out. Not every strategy will serve its purpose. The end objective of story estimation is the same regardless of which method you select. Various techniques, on the other hand, provide different opportunities for you and your team to engage in a variety of talks, so change your estimation strategy depending on the type of conversation you want to have. What matters most is that you help your team understand the problems and limitations. If estimating takes too long, you are probably not using a strategy correctly. 

#### **Planning Poker**
Planning Poker is a method of estimating that uses story points to determine the complexity of a task. The story point values that can be assigned are determined by the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. Each of these symbolizes a different level of complexity for the overall project.

The basic concept is that the product owner hands out a deck of cards to each team member, each with a number, question or pass printed on it. After reading a user story, team members display their preferred estimate, ask a question or pass. The card's value should reflect the amount of time and effort necessary to finish the story.

*Advantages*
- One of the most widely used estimating method.
- Enables all of the team to participate at all times.
- Supports the team in visualising and learning from many viewpoints.

*Disadvantages*
- Not appropriate for large teams with many members.
- Not appropriate for estimating a large number of story points.
- It can be time consuming.
- Some team members may find story points more difficult to estimate than others, resulting in lengthy discussions.



#### **Dot Voting**
Dot voting is a simple way of indicating how much effort you expect something to take. This ranking method helps you prioritize these issues by ranking them from most to least important, allowing you to focus your efforts where they are most required.

Start by visualizing your user stories on a whiteboard or in a digital tool and assign a colour to each one of them. Then decide on a scale to use as a group, preferably one with a range from 1 to 5. Now ask everyone to add the number of dots to a story that best depicts the amount of efforst required to finish it. Discuss results after everyone has voted and solve any disagreements. 

*Advantages*
- This is a good technique for teams that are already established rather than new teams.
- It is a useful tool for visualizing opinions.
- This is a good solution when there are too many items in the backlog.

*Disadvantages*
- Rather than being an estimating tool, this is more of a decision-making tool.
- It is hard to avoid bias.
- When votes are not privately kept, it is quite easy for group thinking to occur.

#### **Affinity Estimation**
Comparisons are at the heart of affinity. This technique is used to help those who are unsure about what is most or least important. Affinity estimation depends on comparisons rather than asking the team to generate an estimate on the spot.

The first story point is chosen by the product owner, who then asks the team to estimate on a scale the effort required to complete it. There are no discussions. When you read the next story, all you have to do is compare it to the one before. If your team members have different viewpoints on a particular story, at this point you can have an open discussion about it.

*Advantages*
- This method reduces the amount of confusion.
- This strategy works well for smaller teams.
- It helps for the faster processing of stories.

*Disadvantages*
- It is not suitable for handling a large number of backlog items.
- Time consuming.
