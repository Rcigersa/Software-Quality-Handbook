### Task Estimation
Why is task estimation important and how is it carried out?
To plan and estimate tasks, developers have to complete five processes in the following order: 
- Create User Stories: should be written by product owner in a way that ensures a clear depiction of the customerâ€™s requirements so that they are comprehensible. 
- Approve, estimate and commit user stories: approve user stories for a sprint and estimate as a team the work necessary for developing the outlined functionality from process 1. 
- Create tasks: go back to the now committed user stories from step 2 and divide them into specific tasks documented in a task list. Ideally this is conducted during a task planning meeting. 
- Estimate Tasks: During task estimation meetings held by the Scrum core team, the necessary efforts for completing each individual task are estimated and documented in an effort estimated task list.
- Create sprint backlog: During sprint planning meetings held by the Scrum core team, a sprint backlog containing all tasks to be completed in the sprint are created. 


### Estimation in Scrum
Estimation in Scrum gives developers the opportunity to estimate required efforts for a given project which helps to plan ahead and ensure a successful completion if done correctly. 

Product backlog estimation: This is necessary to make long-term estimations and prioritize tasks.
- Select number of stories for the first sprint. 
- Make first sprint short (1 week instead of 1 month)
- Be aware that changes to the estimation may happen as the project progresses. 
- Document the progress in a burndown chart (x-axis are the sprints and the y-axis are the story points) to give all stakeholders visibility. 

### Sprint backlog estimation 
This gives an overview over the number of tasks to be completed and therefore enables a fair distribution of the workload on each of the team members.
- Convert user stories in tasks and estimate the workload in hours.
- If a task exceeds 8 h duration divide it further. 
- Document the results in another chart (the days of the sprint on the x-axis and the number of hours on the y-axis)

### Creating estimates in an agile team
- Assign values to buckets and select user stories to be sorted into the buckets accordingly. 
- Discuss the features and requirements of each story.
- Vote within the team to make decisions.
