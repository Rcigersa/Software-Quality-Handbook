# Code Reviews
### Practices to follow when trying to debug a code
- Establish your role in the review process: author or reviewer. The author creates the code, the reviewer investigates, examines and reports.
- Establish the platform and methodology to ensure the smooth running of the review process.
- Establish the appropriate review technique: 
  1. Over the Shoulder: author is looked at while investigating the code. Use this method for **short pieces of code only**, as it demands a lot of attention to detail.
  2. Email pass-around: code is sent to reviewers by the author or SCM system.
  3. Pair Programming: source code is developed by two authors and then reverse engineered. 
  4. Tool-assisted: use tools to the review the code, regardless whether you are a reviewer or author.
- Omitting appropriate debugging procedures can potentially result in expensive or time consuming efforts to fix problems at a later stage of the development process. It is therefore crucial that the above mentioned techniques are used whenever developing a piece of code.
- Maintaining a consistent coding style is necessary to allow the company to respond to errors in a fast and efficient manner, as well as enable efficient design and implementation processes.
- We aim to provide secure applications, which can only be achieved if employees follow the security review protocols.
- Appropriate code review enables us to deliver services and create projects our stakeholders trust and come back to.
